# DungeonJS
A short dungeon game made with JS and JQuery

The first question is, I'm sure, why all of the files are PHP when there is no PHP inside, just HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. The answer is simple. I started it in PHP... then switched to JavaScript and JQuery.

It is a browser game: http://le1.org/dungeonJS/

It is an update of the Java game that I did a month or a couple of months ago.
- I changed the language (now, it is in English and no more in French)
- It is playable with the mouse (no more the keyboard)
- I improved much parts of it (and the most important is the creation of the room)

I always stopped at level 4.

DungeonJS is a way for me to practise my knowledge of JavaScript and especially JQuery.
I didn't know JQuery a month ago.

TO DO:
- I have to work on the next levels
- I have to create a language file
- I have to create more functions to make DungeonJS much more easy to create levels
- I guess there are much ways to improve the JavaScript... I need to check it in a few weeks

LOVE & HATE:
I hate JavaScript. I hate the fact that all the sources are available to everybody.
BUT, I love JQuery.
